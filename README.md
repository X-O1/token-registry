# Token Registry v1.01

**Token Registry** is designed to manage and enforce which tokens are permitted within any EVM-compatible protocol. It provides a modular, permissioned registry that can be integrated into DeFi applications to control token access and maintain protocol integrity. Token Registry v2.01 will enable DAOs, or on-chain governance systems to have control over the registry.
